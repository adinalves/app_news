<h2 align="Left">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>

   <p align="justify">
   This application for searching News through the API provided by <a href="https://newsapi.org/">NewsAPI</a> very well documented and structured.<br>
   Here was my second experience using APIs, and I did well in both, despite the doubts I had about how to consult, I managed to understand the concept, and how to do it.
   Certainly with a lot of practice I will learn more and more about it.
   I also learned a lot about new widgets, layouts, and logic.
